# Skeleton of a generic release script

# features:
# - only runs locally, no need for github api
# - language agnostic; can be used with any project
# - for simplicity for now: only supports monotonically incrementing

# ./release
# - add recent commits to an [Unreleased] section of the changelog.
#   - Unreleased - SHA    so that further invocations won't add duplicate commits

# ./release 1.0.4
# - if 1.0.4 isn't mentioned in the changelog yet:
#   - if a 1.0.4 tag exists then that's an error
#   - ensure 1.0.4 is the highest tag of this series
#   - find the range of commits and insert them into the changelog
      range=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null)
      [ -n "$range ] && prev="$prev..HEAD"
      git log $range --pretty=format:"* %s"
#   - update the version number in the shellscript to 1.0.4
#   - print a message asking to clean up the readme and then run release again
#
# - if 1.04 IS mentioned in the changelog, then the user must be ready to go
#   - show diff to user, ask for confirmation
#   - commit changes with a 'release 1.0.4' message
#     - git commit -m "Release version 1.0.0"
#   - create a 1.0.4 tag
#     - git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Relese version 1.0.0"
#   - push changes and tags
#     - git push && git push --tags
#   - update the version number to 1.0.5dev
